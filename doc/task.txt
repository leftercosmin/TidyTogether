GaW (Garbage Monitoring on Web)

Develop a Web application to manage information related to the collection, sorting, and recycling of waste – by category: household, paper, plastic, etc. – at the level of citizens, authorized personnel, and decision-makers. The system will support user reporting of locations where a substantial amount of garbage has accumulated, with the goal of facilitating clean-up efforts. At set time intervals (day, week, month), numerical and graphical reports will be generated – available in HTML, CSV, and PDF formats – regarding the current situation at the neighborhood/locality level, highlighting the cleanest and dirtiest areas. Bonus: include a simulator for the recycling processes.
